# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
Louise - You mentioned that your interested in Great Britain's theater market, especially musicals.  Analyzing the data, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so I would advise to produced the play for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
